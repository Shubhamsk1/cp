Spoiler You start at depth 0.
Add as many '(' as are required for first digit.
After the first digit, add as many '(' or ')' as are required to 
go from the depth of the first digit to the depth of the second digit. 
Continue like this until the end of the string.
Remember to add some ')' at the end to get back to depth 0.

This is obviously optimal - for example you can't go from depth 6 to depth 2 with less than four paranthesis chars.
